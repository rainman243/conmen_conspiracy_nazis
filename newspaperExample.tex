Throughout the years I have experienced extraordinary events that some would consider paranormal. I have never seen an alien or UFO. These are my personal experiences, which is to say I observed these events. Among them are a few repeating categories, I left a list of them as an appendix. Most of this occurred to me over the last seven years; I'll focus on that period.

\begin{window}[2,c,\includegraphics[width=2.8in]{profilepic.jpeg},\centerline{\textit{mattwoods243@outlook.com}}]

In 2015, I was hit with a mental storm of "information", seemingly out of nowhere which I interpreted as real for argument's sake, since it seemed urgent (i.e. a thought experiment). I could not make out anything meaningful, compared to the news and what I saw on the ground. My brain was absorbing information about nukes and a coming Nazi attack. I did not have Trump pegged as Hitler, he wasn't even elected yet. Much of it happened after he announced his candidacy that fateful day on the escalator. I assumed Hillary would easily beat him. I did not yet comprehend him, or even the Nazis for that matter. This is to say that the nature of the Nazis is dictated remotely by malicious aliens, whereabouts unknown. It was years before I started to realize something like this was occurring. Occurring, not only to me, but others as well. It was a rude awakening, into a hell I imagined seven years ago, but discarded because I thought the chances were so low of such an event. I don't believe the Nazis to be a purely human phenomenon at this point, in the year 2022. Honing in on this could even have implications for WWII history. It appears that instead of it being "aliens" or "Nazis", the situation is literally both simultaneously. Fascist aliens, ala "Body Snatchers" and "Manchurian Candidate" is not the answer most people want to know as to why our country and the globe are experiencing such a wave of "collective psychosis". It appears, to me, that we are under attack by aliens who have found cooperators in the fascists. 

During the 2015 episode, I experienced bizarre behavior from other humans, especially at the San Jose airport, complete with a police officer accusing me directly of war crimes (e.g. "Entire families!!!"). I have no idea what he was screaming about, but he did mention that he is of Iraqi descent and that these events happened in Iraq... somewhere. He wouldn't come forth with anything specific. Disturbingly, I did deploy to Iraq during my time in the US Navy. I witnessed no war crimes on the USA side. With that said, Navy SEALs have been accused of being too lethal in the past, and I would optimally be doing something similar, if not exactly the same as them, if I was still in the "vanilla teams". That airport cop could have been responding to the 2015 article by Mark Mazetti of the New York Times about DEVGRU (FKA Seal Team Six). I never even screened for DEVGRU: I have no official relation to them. They know what the rules are, and, yes: there are rules in war. The experiences I describe here almost strictly take place years after I separated from the Navy. My name was Matthew Burns at the time and I discharged honorably out of SEAL Team Five, after a Bahrain tour for the better part of two years. 

The same day, at that airport, a janitor came up to me while I was waiting for my flight. He said something to the effect of, "You may have invented it, but other people can use it too". I had no idea what the guy was talking about; I never met either him or the cop before: same airport, same day. People were becoming bizarre and cryptic around me. I heard, inside of my head, something like, "Your shadows go everywhere". During the same visit, at the same airport, after the cop accused me of war crimes, some old guy I got a light from is sitting around telling me how he has a compound in San Jose, and to make my way up there: it was weird, but less noticeable than the other two people. The next year, I did move to the San Francisco Bay Area, but more weirdness had descended by that point: the Trump Administration. 

To recap, they thought that I had invented something previously and that they can use that thing, whatever it is, if they want, and that I'm a war criminal. This is nonsense on all counts: complete fabrications. I had no idea what was happening. I was having visions and conversations with beings which were not present, but sounded human (e.g. "We're going to stop the simulation now!" "No, don't stop the simulation." "Who is this?" "Matthew Burns." "Oh... OK." The end: they did seem quite human.). Which is it? Aliens? Humans from the future? Nazis? The Rise of the machines, Google style? Unknown unknowns, such as deities not inside of this universe? My own pure insanity, having nothing to do with reality whatsoever? Which one was it? As the years go by, it seems as if all of these scenarios were playing out simultaneously: an option I never even considered in my quest for the most important factor of the equation. A fun fact that I was not initially aware of: all of those factors are important concurrently and contemporarily. I cannot stress how crucial this is. Prior to 2015, I could count on one hand the events that I could not explain logically. Now, I have so many potential possibilities that I need a spreadsheet and categories to keep track of the many anomalies. If I can't find data or evidence on a topic, I don't bother writing about it. That basic principle does not seem to slow down Republican lawmakers lately, who somehow get away with bold claims and zero evidence whatsoever. The Trump fanatics have truly lost their minds, and I believe the story is broader than the man himself. I think we are under attack by hostile aliens and some of them know it, maybe even DJT. An old Israeli head of space said as much, without addressing the fascist variables at hand. Let there be no confusion: Trump is Hitler. He is coordinating with aliens behind our back: pure evil to be sure, but this? I suppose that is why the Nazis like it so much, the lie/con/evil/money paradigm; may doom be unto them expeditiously, full stop.
I took a flight to Seattle, from San Diego, without preplanning. Before I arrived, I experienced what I term, "Extreme Horror". The feeling came first, then questions about the apocalypse, insinuating that I was the last living human. I assume this is the "simulation" "they" were speaking of before: whatever scenario they happen to be playing. They insinuated heavy torture, but the fear kicked in a bit before the language. That is torture, in and of itself: some kind of direct terrorism. I had never thought that way in my life: it was as if speaking with an alien or human not present in the environment, which was on an airline at 30K feet. That, while experiencing a terror equivalent to a deep stimulation electrode to my amygdala: the fear part of the brain. I have experienced fear and adrenaline in combat before, yet this was exponentially more powerful. Throughout this time, I was subjected to random incarceration at mental facilities. Many times, people would simply create a story with no basis in fact and the police would come and put me in a psych ward, such as the VA for days on end. What is the problem with all of that? I answer with another question: what was their complaint to begin the process? Mostly unwarranted and at worst fabricated excuses account for the bulk of this activity. Trump had a "good ole' days" speech, where, according to him, an innocent person could be detained without any cause or even suspicion of guilt in a mental facility: "the good ole' days". Again, I'm seeing a weird hand at play here, across many people. 

What I said is proving correct, but seven years in the future, which I hope those fascist a-holes will admit. The "fascist aliens" hypothesis is looking more likely by the day. I think they, the Nazis, are not in control of themselves. They are pirated by a giant machine, e.g. "Just following orders". The Nazis DO become violent and perpetrate atrocities, lies and conspiracies, as is their way. The otherworldly aliens (which I think are influencing and commanding the Nazis) might seem like deities, or ghosts, or nothing at all to the uninformed observer. I noticed an extreme difference between 2015 and 2022, which is the certainty that I am not alone. Many would throw up their hands, cite the deity of their religion of choice and call it a day. What else could such a feeling and experience mean? My belief is that it has nothing to do with our religions whatsoever, and that it is, in fact, malicious aliens. The Bible does warn of deception and tests along the spiritual path. I don't intend to be made a sucker by the dark lord, the prince of lies.

After the 2015 gaslighting round, I was exhausted. I looked for anything in reality that could corroborate my deep feeling of doom. What I experienced as a gauntlet of information and interrogation r.e. the apocalypse. It was the spookiest story that I can recall. I thought it was actually happening in real-time, but no. There was very little external evidence at that point. 

In the year 2022, there is evidence of UFOs/UAPs as witnessed by the Navy. The "Tic-Tac" story from the 60 Minutes interview with two Naval aviators comes to mind (Frevor and Detrich of the USS Nimitz). They didn't want to be in the public sphere, but they came forward out of a sense of duty, which I share with them. Doom on them. They have perfect vision and know how to target ID, because they are LITERALLY fighter pilots. To me, it sounds like advance force operations conducting surveillance on the US Navy prior to an invasion. The likelihood of such a craft being of an earthbound nation state hovers around zero. 

My personal experience is bizarre enough as it is; the military consensus of the "psychic" attacks which I endure is becoming too much for me to keep a straight face. We are under attack by the worst aliens that humans have ever encountered and they are making a fascist play, presumably worldwide. They're like the Persians: barbaric conquerors, like Xerxes. Hitler and Trump: they obey the same alien. See Appendix Two for a simple correlation match between Nazis and Trump. They use people like Hitler or Trump as military generals... to take over a nation state at first, and then, ultimately, the globe. The Nazis are Evil. The aliens are the ones that facilitate their fascist treachery, which I suppose means they are more evil than the Nazis. I'm not even sure how I know this, or if it is even true: they make one giant pile of American bodies: Persians to be sure. I brushed it all off and returned to graduate school in 2016 Fall. I had assumed that the answer to my question was that my mind was lost and that I was wrong about everything. I was mistaken. 

2017 was another banner year for me to realize that the Nazis were afoot. Again, I began to feel another presence that I could not place. Again, I was certain that the Nazis were operating on me. I didn't make out Trump to be Hitler yet I became convinced that my family was participating in the Nazi conspiracy. It was my second time thinking about the Nazis and believing it. Since I was not part of their cult, that must have meant that they were planning on doing something evil and blaming it on me as the so called, "useful idiot". 

After that shift, I again searched reality for signs confirming my convictions. Again I failed to find any tangible evidence and concluded that my mind was once again fooling me. I ran out of money in graduate school while trying to keep track of the Nazi conspiracy and decided a different scene was in order. After 2017, I left school to work, yet it took the better part of a year to get into it. I had two identical offers and chose Google for a business data science and engineering role. Google may have been the craziest of them all.

At that point, it was the year 2018. I moved from PA, where I was staying with my mother (a Nazi conspirator), to Mountain View and it seemed like a corner was turned. In reality, there was much more to come. The Nazis take a certain amount of time to pollute my environment each time I move. Within one year, I was experiencing that eerie feeling once again: that I was being set up, now with an employer, Google. 

I left Google and went back to San Diego to observe and make contact with a few precious people. The effect was stronger than when I left San Diego in 2017. It was as though a force was animating the people around me. I couldn't account for their weird flow, and I still can't. If I had something to do with the system they were using, it eluded me. 

On a 2019 trip to San Diego, I vowed that I would remain awake until I found the cause of the disturbance that I was experiencing. I have remained true to this pledge, in the face of even more "paranormal" experiences, most of them unpleasant. I remember hearing a squeaky internal voice say something like, "This is going to get weird!". Apparently the weird of that day and age was just a precursor. Th squeaky voice was not exaggerating; more weird was yet to come.

When I quit Google in 2019, I was awake. At first, I thought that some kind of "manual" conspiracy about me was underway. My question was, "How could it track me so fast?" An interested reader is probably still wondering who is to blame: the author, or seemingly everyone else he encounters. To that point, I was still doing that math myself. After all, "No matter where you go... there you are". At that point, I experienced back to back harassment and problems. I began to see that I was not the problem at all, even though "look at yourself first" is a tried and true principle. 

The world around me became very spooky and chock full of lies. I assumed the Nazis must have some kind of intel network: a "Nazi CIA", if you will. Any time I swipe a credit card, my information pops up for them and hell is soon to follow. I thought about that: the nature of the treachery and I was enduring. With modern technology, they might be able to string together some kind of operation on me. It wasn't aliens concerning me at that point, but I could see a massive conspiracy unfolding, tracking me in ways I could not explain (bank, ems, police, hotels, random people, roommates, banks, etc). They were all wrong, including me at some points. In retrospect, I think that those people are being unduly influenced by powers of which they know not. I've heard, via voices inside my head, that our planet is under attack and our enemy can control biology to a certain extent. They may think they are psychic, or speaking with God: it is a ruse. 

I have had my fair share of wrestling with the what and the how and the why of it all. Perhaps they are being hit with something similar to my own experience, and they have "chosen" to believe and obey those alien orders, thinking it is God or a sympathetic ear that they communicate to. It could not be more the opposite. My interpretation is that they haven't thought it through, and that such a dynamic is evidence of an advanced foe which is not of this world. 

According to this internal "presence", what sets me (Matt Woods) apart is that I'm not only human, but make their efforts to that effect a laughing stock. I'm fairly sure that those Nazi GOP evangelists (MAGA) will meet their doom barking up wrong obscene tree, like burglars in the night. If they EVER CARED ABOUT THE UNTIED STATES OF AMERICA, they have something pertinent to share with us all, but DO NOT expect them to exemplify a shred of humanity. They have no souls to speak of. 

The full story is likely to be much more complicated, somehow. For example: the only reason the Nazis were able to get their hands on me is that the aliens they serve stole a component from a higher tech stack, apparently a "useful idiot". It would certainly be "out of our pay grade as humans. The Nazis play with great forces that they know not. It would be the equivalent of stealing a piece of equipment from the gods. The catch is, that specific component is "entangled" with a much larger system. They can't separate it, and it doesn't at all work with just that one innovation. It's a cheap hack; it only has to work good enough to exterminate all life on the planet Earth.

If our species is not an ongoing concern, why bother with something well thought out? It's just good enough for them to pump Trump lies directly to a human brain, like "The Matrix Four". They figure it's plenty to achieve their perverse goals, and then it won't matter, because they can fabricate a back story once human kind is eliminated. 

This is why we can't have nice things. Our days are numbered, so why invest in us? They would not. This is perhaps what that overhanging man meant to me when he said I invented something, but anyone can use it. They can use the bastardized version crafted specifically for their doom. The question remains, if I invented something, who engineered and produced it? I would be an idea guy at most, which is to say not much, as far as it goes. 

I started thinking back about what I was doing in engineering over the years. Sure, I did some basic research in Brain-Computer Interfacing as a contributor at the Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience. Nothing in any of our work, there or elsewhere globally, could account for humans all of a sudden hearing each other, as if it is "The Matrix". With that said, I was thinking about the concept of BCBI: Brain-Computer-Brain Interfacing. The concept is two human beings communicating thoughts and emotions and so on with a machine between the two managing the connection. Assuredly, such a problem would not be fair game for an engineer circa year 2017. 

I theorized a machine that could bring two human minds together using something akin to Jensen-Shannon divergence measures, minimizing the gap between two human minds. I spray painted an equation suggesting such a system on the floor of my kitchen in 2017. In 2019, I was wondering if perhaps something more advanced than me was watching  me, making things out of my engineering wet dreams and applying those products to me. I would not call that an invention; something would have had to have  synthesized the solution, apparently far beyond a human capability. 

I never even looked into such a thing with seriousness, and I am as serious as a heart attack. 

I remember one time thinking that if they wanted to "cyborg" me (i.e. attaching a prosthetic compute capacity to my meager meat), then I would go on as such. That is as close as I could ever come to cooperation with the gods. It may be all too easy for them to equip technology to meat not available to the general public in 2022. I doubt their motives: they are trying to kill me with aplomb. I reject their invasion: I will do whatever I can to protect and educate us against that threat.

Trump is Hitler. Don't be embarrassed if you believed him at first. I did. The man is casually an utter disgrace to America. Do not believe a word out of his lying lips; Trump lies easier than he breathes. Doom on him... expeditiously, and his "men" as well. I hope he finds Jesus, lost as he is. Now... let's get back to aliens.

\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Categories of paranormal events}
\begin{itemize}

\item Two events, wrong ordering.

\item Guess combo to two cypher locks within 5 seconds: first time every time, no misses.

\item Lucid dreams: sometimes with the TPG and fascist aliens (including spaceship visibility).

\item Visions which come true several years later. They always feel concurrent, as if the action is imminent. In practice, not at all. 

-\item So called "psychic" communication with beings which are not me. Perhaps nonbiologicals, laughably faster than humans.

\item Extreme experiences which feel something like deep electrode stimulation of my brain, e.g. fear, pain, pleasure, death. A recent CAT scan revealed nothing.

\item Auditory hallucinations: sometimes they sound very human, but not always. When it first kicked in circa 2015, "I heard a clear voice say, "Get in the air." It wasn't a human voice, but could have been some kind of scrambler. Sitting on an airplane in flight with a window seat en route to Seattle. The most extreme fear that I have experienced, yet without anything to justify it. It was so much fear, and then, a voice in my head. It says that I am the only human left alive. I ask, " What about the rest of our life in nature: the plants and animals". They reply, "We will torture you". I ask again, what kind of torture... some kind of mathematical torture?" It was the worst I could come up with. I hear the interrogater say, "Uh... yeah, sure, whatever", with a hint of ineptitude, as if he didn't have a clue. My response, "OK, I'm in." Hell, that is. Within 30 minutes, we landed and the fealing of fear subsided. That was the defintion of terrorism, I have never experienced fear as such to this day.

\item Synchronicities: weird timings in my attention and perceptions that happen simultaneously.

\item Myths and legends: breaking the speed of light, arriving in hell and fighting all of the demons, including the "Queen". Achieving mastery and acquireing mass: the only true money to be had in the universe... alien money. 

\item Sci-fi stories that I perceive as having something to do with myself.

\item Vivid dreams of Albert Einstein as a young man, perhaps my age at the time. We were attending a class, apparently together, in small college desks at a lecture hall. I felt something to my left and slowly turned. What I saw was Einstein, in suit and tie, with a mustache, at the little desk. He was enraged, just pure anger and without words. He was staring directly at me.

\item Another vivid dream with physical pain; I felt a sharp bite on my arm, only to look and see a dog (maybe German Shepherd) with a full lock on my arm. It physically hurt, I could feel the bite. It wasn't that painful, as far as pain goes (I would know). The dog let go, and I looked at my arm: skin unbroken.

\item At the foot of Starbucks Stanford, I curled up for the night under a blanket as a homeless. In a lucid dream, I awakened to extreme physical pain; more than the SEALs in BUD/S. Since it is a lucid dream, I could sense my normal body. Head, eyes, ears, two arms, two legs: awake in a dream. Shortly after, in extreme pain, as if it was my universe, something came. I was completely controlled for a few seconds. My body was made from standing into the "worship" position. That is to say, against my will, to my knees, and then hand outstretched on the ground. With all my might, I managed to stand and put my hands in the air. The pain was PIERCING. I exclaimed, "COME!!! WHERE ARE YOU!?" All I sensed is something resembling my father, eerily infusing me with utter pain. There was nothing to hit, nothing I could fight. Then, I woke up to lying on the ground. I was never afraid, yet trying to fight something which I could not touch.

\item A vivid dream of me swimming by myself in the middle of a vast ocean. I'm doing the side stroke against a light swell whilst missiles fly overhead, detonating nearby. I see flashes, as the warheads ignite: a terrifying blast, which would doom me by radiation alone, if I were awake. I remember readying myself for the waves that were sure to follow, still swimming. When I awoke, I knew I must be Sarah Connor from Terminator Two. The Jury is still out on that one.


\item Other.
